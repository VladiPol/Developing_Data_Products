## Goals per Game without Overtime  

This Shiny App is for predicting the under/over (dynamic) game score without the overtime in NHL dependent on score difference before the game

The data (NHL 2015 - 2016 Season) are from the german betting portal [wettpoint.com](http://eishockey.wettpoint.com/liga/nhl-usa.html) that contains the information about the score for each game.  

**Note**: The data were collected manually, there are no any API to collect data, because of this the current data might not be 100% accurate.
