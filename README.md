# Developing Data Products Project - Prediction for Goals per Game without Overtime in Nation Hockey League (NHL) in the Season 2015 / 2016

Project for the class Developing Data Products in Coursera

This Shiny App is for prediction of Sum Goals per Game without Overtime. Data Source (manually colelcted): http://www.nhl.com or 
http://eishockey.wettpoint.com/liga/nhl-usa.html

The dataset contains the basic information of each game. From the basic information I got the cumulated information (goals, against goals per home team and visitor team etc.) with help of analytical functions from Oracle Express Edition Database.

Note: Since I didn't use the API to collect data, the current data might not be 100% accurate.

The project is on Shiny User Showcase page (Shiny Apps with popular appeal): https://vladimir.shinyapps.io/Project_NHL_GpG/
